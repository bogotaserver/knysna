            <article>
                <p>The Knysna Elephant Park (est. 1994) was the first facility in South Africa to house and care for orphaned African elephants.
                   Over the last twenty years, the park has cared for and raised more than forty elephants. These animals include relocated 
                   animals, orphaned calves, and elephants rescued from culls. Some have become part of the resident herd, others have moved 
                   onto other reserves and facilities in the Western and Eastern Cape, depending on their personalities, bonds with other 
                   animals and welfare needs.
                </p>

                <p>The present KEP herd numbers eight, the largest domesticated matriarchal herd in the country. Our style of management 
                   offers guests the opportunity to get up close and personal with our elephants, on elephant terms. Responsible and 
                   educational interactions allow guests to appreciate the awe-inspiring presence of these animals, but still give the 
                   elephants the space and freedom to choose where they want to move, what they want to eat and who they want to interact with. 
                   There are no fences to spoil the close encounter and our environment encourages elephants to exhibit natural behaviours.
